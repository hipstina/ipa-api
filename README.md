# The IPA API

![GIF](https://github.com/hipstina/ipa-api/blob/master/preview.gif)

I built a simple web app built for API data.

### Project status
- [X] Completed
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Archived   

## Product Description
This is a web app for filtering beers by style , ABV, and IBU. It was built in vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. 

I pulled data from https://punkapi.com/. PunkAPI is a free and open source project. 

 
## Technologies used
- HTML 5
- CSS (& SCSS)
- JavaScript/ES6

## To Do's ?
At this point, I am basically done with this project. However, I can't help myself from tweaking things, so there are 2 main items I may add on later:
 - I want to add a button to each card that triggers an overlay of the beer description. I would need to query the correct DOM elements to trigger a sibling element , or something like that. 
 - I also want to make the sidebarMenu toggle into and out of view, so that the app works well on mobile too. 


## Takeaways
In total I spent about 4-5 days on this application.

Some of the JS/browser technology concepts I got to apply in this project include:
+ connecting to an API by sending XMLHttpRequests
+ cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
+ displaying API data 
+ building HTML elements
+ removing HTML elements recursively
+ filtering objects properties 
+ building tools to filter and sort API data from the client-side
+ linking form inputs to event handlers
+ event delegation, bubbling, hoisting, call stacks, template literals, navigating the DOM...

This was a really fun and practical little project! I learned a lot and feel ready to try something a little more challenging. Cracking open a cold one now üç∫
